Here's the corrected version:

**BASIC DETAILS OF THE PROJECT:** This is a very basic Application Form for JK Police Sub-Inspector Recruitment, in which you can add an image, signature, and domicile certificate.

Just clone using HTTP or SSH link:

--> Use the command *git clone ----PASTE COPIED LINK HERE----*.
--> Now you can right-click on the file named ****index.html****. You will have an option to start with the liver server. Just click on it.

****You will be redirected to the localhost page where you can access this form.****
